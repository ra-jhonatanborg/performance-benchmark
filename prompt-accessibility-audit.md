Audit Checklist
1. General Page Load & Responsiveness
Confirm the page loads without errors.
Test for responsive design across common breakpoints (desktop, tablet, mobile).
2. Images & Media
List all <img> elements missing meaningful alt attributes.
Include image metadata (e.g., src, class, alt value).
Accessible Media: Ensure all videos include captions and all audio content has transcripts.
3. Form Accessibility
Verify each form field has an associated <label> element.
Ensure placeholder text is not used as a substitute for labels.
Check that form instructions, hints, and required field indicators are clear and accessible.
4. Error Handling
Submit invalid or incomplete forms and check that:

Error messages are displayed clearly.
Errors are announced to screen readers.
Input fields in error are programmatically marked (aria-invalid, aria-describedby, etc.).
5. Keyboard Navigation
Tab through the page and ensure all interactive elements (links, buttons, inputs) are focusable and operable.
Check for skip links at the top of the page (e.g., "Skip to main content") and verify they function correctly.
6. Focus Management
Check that focus is correctly managed:

When modals open/close, focus should move inside and return logically.
After dynamic content loads, ensure the focus doesn't get lost.
7. Landmarks & Semantic Structure
Validate the use of HTML5 landmarks: <header>, <nav>, <main>, <aside>, <footer>.
Ensure they are present and used appropriately.
8. Headings Structure
Headings (<h1> through <h6>) should follow a logical order without skipping levels.
There should be one primary <h1> per page.
9. Color Contrast
Check text and background color combinations for sufficient contrast.
Use WCAG 2.1 AA standards (minimum 4.5:1 for normal text).
10. ARIA Attributes & Roles
Confirm appropriate use of ARIA roles (role="dialog", role="navigation", etc.).
Check for misuse or redundant roles that may confuse screen readers.
11. Language Attribute
Confirm that the <html> tag includes a correct lang attribute (e.g., <html lang="en">).
12. Dynamic Content
For any JavaScript-rendered content (e.g., dropdowns, modals, alerts):

Ensure it is accessible by keyboard.
Check if it is properly announced to screen readers.
13. Accessible Tables
Ensure data tables use semantic markup (<th>, <caption>, scope, etc.).
Tables should be navigable via keyboard and understandable by screen readers.
